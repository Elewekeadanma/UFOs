# UFOs
## Overview of the project
The purpose of this project is to display information about UFO sightings that was stored in a data.js file as an interactive webpage.There will ba an article title, article as well as table on the webpage. The data from the data.js will be displayed as a table and will have muliple and easy to use filters to select relevant information from the table.
##  Results
I placed filters on the Date, City, State, Country and Shape fields. So when you load the webpage , all the data from the data file is displayed on the page. However if you  want to narrow down the data to display only the information for example, the date 1/4/2010 as shown below, all you need to do is to enter 1/4/2010 in the date field ,click anywhere on the page and only the dates with a value of 1/4/2010 and their corresponding data will be displayed on the table in the webpage.

You can also narrow down your data based on more than one search. So you can do a search by date, City, State, Country or Shape or by a combination of any of these.
As shown in the image below, I did a search based on the Date as well as the State fields.

##  Summary
One drawback of this new design is that you have to first look into the table to find out what information you can get out of the table.

Two recommedations for further development are:

- Using drop-down lists instead of text boxes. That way, a user will not need to go through the table first before making a selection and instead of having to enter data, the user will just need to select relevant information.
- Also, it will be nice if there was a message displayed once a search has been completed.
