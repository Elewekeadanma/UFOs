# UFOs
## Overview of the project
The purpose of this project is to diaplay information about UFO sightings that was stored in a data.js file as an interactive webpage.There will ba an article title, article as well as table on the webpage. The data will be diplayed as a table and will have muliple and easy to use filters to sift through the data on the table.
##  Results
I placed filters on the date, city, state, country and shape fields. So when you load the webpage , all the data form the data file is displayed on the page. However if you  want to narrow down the data to display only the information for example, the date 1/4/2010 as shown below, all you need to do is to type 1/4/2010 in the date field and then click anywhere on the page and the data will filter out your data to display only date fields that have a value of 1/4/2010 and their corresponding data.
